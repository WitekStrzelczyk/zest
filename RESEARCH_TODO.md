1. **Quick wins** - Color picker, IP info, time zones (low complexity, high value)
2. **Developer tools** - Homebrew, system info
3. **Productivity** - Calendar, Pomodoro, translation

**Immediate priority:** Story 19 (Preferences Window) - this is the only remaining foundation story needed before adding new community features.
